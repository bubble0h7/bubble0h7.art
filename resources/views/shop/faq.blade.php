                <p>Please expect shipping delays! Domestic orders might be delayed 2-3 days,
                    but international orders could take 3-4 months to arrive.</p>

            <h2>Q: where is the store based?</h2>
            <p>A: New Zealand</p>
            <h2>Q: what is this store's return and exchange policy?</h2>
            <p>A: I do not provide change of mind returns or exchanges so please choose carefully. 
                If your order is not up to the quality standard you expected, 
                please contact me to arrange either an alternative product (depending on stock) 
                or a refund. I can not be held responsible for damage caused by postal services, or lost parcels.</p>
            <h2>Q: do you accept orders placed outside of New Zealand?</h2>
            <p>A: I do. I know the shipping cost is a little insane, but that's the international shipping prices we're 
                dealing with over here and I have to cover my ass, sorry! 
                Feel free to contact me for a custom postage quote on the off chance I can send your order for cheaper, 
                depending on where you are.</p>
            <h2>Q: how long will it take to receive my order?</h2>
            <p>A: Once shipped most domestic orders take anywhere from 2 to 10 business days to arrive depending on 
                the efficiency of your local postal service. International shipping delivery times may 
                vary between 2 and 12 weeks.</p>
            <h2>Q: when will my order be sent out?</h2>
            <p>A: I'll try to get your order posted within a few working days, but please allow 1-2 weeks at most for me 
                to process your order.</p>
